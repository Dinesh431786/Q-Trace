⚛️ Q-Trace Pro — Quantum Python Security Analyzer
Detects true quantum-native, adversarial threats in Python: probabilistic bombs, entanglement, chained logic, steganography, and quantum anti-debug. Shows real quantum risk — no classical simulation, no safe mode.

<!![Q trace img](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8de04a6-5b5b-4619-8112-c05c1891d903)

🚀 Features
True quantum-native adversarial pattern detection
Probabilistic bombs, chained logic, quantum steganography, entanglement, and anti-debugging logic
Real quantum risk scoring — using Cirq quantum simulator (no regex, no fake simulation)
Supports file uploads and direct code snippet analysis
Visualizes logic extraction, risk graphs, quantum state probabilities
Quantum ML anomaly detection for advanced threat identification
“Red Team” adversarial code samples (optional)

🛡️ What Makes Q-Trace Pro Unique?
Brutal honesty: Exposes quantum-inspired and adversarial code patterns missed by classical/static tools
No safe mode: Analyses without restrictions — for advanced security and red team research
No classical simulation: All patterns are mapped to quantum circuits and simulated
Full logic extraction: Highlights all suspicious logic blocks, chained triggers, and cross-function threats

💡 How to Use
Upload a .py Python file or paste a code snippet into the web UI
